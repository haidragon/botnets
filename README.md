这是一组无组织的僵尸网络源代码。仅供教育用途

许多项目是彼此的重复或修订。他们中的许多人已经过时了。我的目标是将它们集中在一起，以便它们可编译，并帮助对恶意软件研究感兴趣的人分析它们并从这些样本中学习。



# botnets
This is a collection of botnet source codes, unorganized. For EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY


Many projects are duplicates or revisions of each other. Many of them have outdated depedencies. My goal is to collectively put them together so that they are compilable and help people interested in malware research analyze them and learn from these samples.
